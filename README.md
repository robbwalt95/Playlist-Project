## Project Details

Grab and format music metadata and display it on a webpage. 

Completed in two tasks.

***Task 1 :***

With Python and the TinyTag library, the program goes through a specified directory to store MP3, FLAC, and M4A metadata.
The Python program writes the gathered metadata and their formats to a JSON file.

***Task 2 :***

Specify where on the HTML page to display and use the JavaScript Fetch API to grab the data from the JSON.



## Using This Project Yourself


 1. Place all of your music into one directory and make sure the metadata exists [(Mp3tag)](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/)

 2. In the same directory as **metadata_to_json.py** make sure **data.json** exists and is empty
 3.  In **metadata_to_json.py**, under ```def main():``` change ```path```  to equal your music directory  
 4. Run the Python program and confirm **data.json** was written to 
 5. Copy the table from **example_html.html** into your webpage
 6. Insert **main.js** and **data.json** with your webpage
